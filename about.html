	<h2>Our Mission</h2>
	<p>BRIDGE is a company founded by eight pre-university students hoping to make volunteering opportunities more accessible to the youth. <br> We do this through digital volunteering where young volunteers are able to take part in free online courses provided by us to hone their social media skills. These skills are later volunteered to NGOs and Social Enterprises to help them create or strengthen their social media presence, especially among the youth of today. <br>Volunteer with BRIDGE to join your helping hand to another!
